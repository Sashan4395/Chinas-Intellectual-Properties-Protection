		<p1> I think the china's copyright law is good cause if you don something bad or trying to get benefits from other's creavity then you 
    should get punishment </p1>
    <p2> The China's laws are preety much same as ours and it is good. The solution of the proble is that you will be in jail for 3-4 years 
    or depend on the crime you did. </p2>
